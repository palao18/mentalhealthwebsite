        "I was diagnosed with Chromesthesia when I was 8. Never felt about it as a mental illness, as a kid I used to think everyone was the same as me and would see what I saw.

        If you don't know Chromosthesia is a condition that makes hearing combine with vision, so sounds are represented as visual effects and shapes in the space, sometimes they are big and 3D and fill up the room and I feel I have to leave, sometimes they are subtle and just create distortion usually seen across walls and moving objects.
        
        Really doesn't bother me much, I just have some serious problem with loud stopping noise, like a single person clapping or a door slam. They cause me a really bad headache and foggy vision sometimes.
        
        But I cannot imagine life without having that sound-image connection, I feel it would be like being blind to certain extent, but I dont know, even when in total silence I see dim shapes in the air, something would be missing."

        "Bipolar disorder type 2, and generalized anxiety disorder.

        Depression sucks, it's not so much that I feel sad, I just feel like I can't handle anything. Including the simplest of tasks. I just want everyone to leave me alone. I'll cry at the drop of a hat, and the rest of the time I act like a zombie. I'm easily frustrated, and easily overwhelmed.
        
        I don't experience full blown mania, instead it's hypomania. Which is fun as hell. I feel so creative, and smart, and attractive, and sexual. I have brilliant ideas about things I want to do or make. I laugh a lot, and I smile a lot. I'm usually very shy and introverted, but suddenly I'm friendly to everyone. Conversations come easier. I think about so many things at once, my brain is constantly going. I think that I can totally change my life."

        "I have Social Anxiety Disorder. The best way I can describe it is that it is like basic, everyday tasks such as leaving the house, saying hello, going to public bathrooms alone feel the same as falling off a cliff while being eaten by giant spiders. It really sucks because it prevents you from reaching certain milestones in your life. When I was younger I had Selective Mutism, a different anxiety disorder that meant that for an entire year of my childhood I said nothing. Not a single word. It took me a lot of therapy to come out of that but it lingers on inside.

        People say SAD is like being scared of people judging you. But it is more than that. It is feeling like they are, that you are doing everything wrong all the time. Any laugh you might here in the background is because you did something stupid. Any dirty look is someone showing you how stupid you are, how pathetic you are. I wish that I didn't have a panic attack every time someone says hello to me. I wish I could go to the store on my own, get a part time job, volunteer. But SAD prevents me from doing this, and it burns."

        "I have depression and anxiety. The depression feels like being stuck in a cloud. It's a mental fog that makes me feel tired and useless. I feel like a prisoner of my negative thoughts. My anxiety feels like my heart races and I am overwhelmed with irrational worries. My whole body buzzes."

        "I kind of have an eating disorder? I'm in full denial about it and even typing this right now makes me want to scream, and in about an hour I'll probably remember this comment and think, "I'm so stupid I don't actually have an eating disorder."

        EDNOS. I've never seen any doctor, but that's most likely what I've got. I don't want anyone coming to me with a rant about self-diagnosis because I'm really not trying to.
        
        It's like having a constant battle going on in your head. It's constantly thinking about food. It's not eating for four days straight and then binging on a full box of pasta and then taking laxatives. It's deciding not to have a stick of gum because it has 3 calories. It's hearing someone mention the words food or calories or weight and nearly having a panic attack. It's not hanging out with friends because you don't want to eat in front of anyone. It's weighing yourself ten times a day. It's the only thing on your mind."

        "I suffer from Misophonia and it's awful. Imagine this uncontrollable rage, like you need to punch someone or slam a chair into them, like if someone insulted your family or took what you've worked your whole life towards away from you. Then imagine this feeling whenever your family sits down to eat, or when you're walking with your brother and can hear his footsteps, or when someone walks in the room with a chip and crunches on it."

        "PTSD. It's hell.

        I hate people. I hate crowds. I hate loud noises.
        
        I know where all the possible exits are in any given room at any given time. I also know what random things in a room I can use to kill you or defend myself if I need to.
        
        I feel broken, which makes me feel depressed, which makes me feel anxious because don't want anybody to know I feel depressed. The anxiety doesn't help the paranoia of feeling like the world is a dangerous place in which I can die at any given moment.
        
        Thankfully, mood suppressors and antidepressants have helped immensely. It took awhile to find the right combination."
