    Mental Health has been a growing epidemic over the last few years, the recent pandemic adding greatly to these issues. There is a great lack of awareness about mental health issue, a negative stigma against it, which drives many of those who suffer with them to keep everything bottled up and struggle alone.

    Raising mental health awareness can help you to understand your symptoms, find professional treatment, and, perhaps most importantly, break the mental health stigma that leaves so many people suffering in secret. Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health. Factors in peopleâ€™s lives, interpersonal connections, and physical factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions.
